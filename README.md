# PCM-PULSE-CODE-MODULATION-


ðŸ§  What is PCM?

Pulse Code Modulation (PCM) is a method used to digitally represent analog signals. It samples the amplitude of the analog signal at uniform intervals and then quantizes the sample into a series of digital values. In this project, we simulate PCM using a sine wave.
